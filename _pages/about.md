Greeting! My name is Chuhao Liu(刘楚豪). I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree at [UAV Group](https://uav.hkust.edu.hk) at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My supervisor is [Prof. Shaojie Shen](https://uav.hkust.edu.hk/group/). I receive my MPhi. degree at HKUST as well in 2020. Prior to that, I was an entrepreneur doing swarm drone light show at [XbotPark](wwww.xbotpark.com), where I was supported by [Prof. ZeXiang Li](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/zexiang-li) and [Prof. Ping K. Ko](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/pingko). Even earlier, I receive by BEng degree from [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk) in 2013.

My research interest focuses on autonomous system and semantic perception. I am particularly interested in learning a general 3D representation for mobile robots, which benefit their localization, spatial reasoning and planning.

<!-- I will finish my Ph.D. degree in June 2025, and enter the job market. -->
If you want to collaborate with me, please send me an email.
