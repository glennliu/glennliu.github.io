Greeting! My name is Chuhao Liu(刘楚豪). I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree at [UAV Group](https://uav.hkust.edu.hk) at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). My supervisor is [Prof. Shaojie Shen](https://uav.hkust.edu.hk/group/). I received my MPhi. degree at HKUST as well in 2020. Prior to that, I was an entrepreneur doing swarm drone light show at [XbotPark](wwww.xbotpark.com), where I was supported by [Prof. ZeXiang Li](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/about/people/faculty/zexiang-li) and [Prof. Ping K. Ko](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/pingko). Even earlier, I receive by BEng degree from [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk) in 2013.

My long-term research goal is to develop a general 3D representation for SLAM and spatial intelligence. In recent years, my work has focused on 3D semantic scene graphs, multi-agent visual SLAM, and 3D scene understanding—key areas for advancing autonomous perception and interaction in complex environments.

If you are interested in collaboration, feel free to reach out by email.
